# Examples

### subclassed_bot.py

This shows an example of a bot that subclasses the `discord.ext.commands.Bot` client. This is my recommended way to 
developing your bot. You can read more on the official documentation [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/index.html).

The `commands` directory and `commands/ping.py` file show you how you would create a working command with the bot.

### classless_bot.py

This shows how you would integrate `cogwatch` into the simpler, non-subclassed bot.
